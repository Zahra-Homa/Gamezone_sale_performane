# Gamezone Sales Analysis
Data storytelling project using Excel and Tableau to explore revenue growth and decline across products, channels, and regions.
## Project Overview
In this project, I worked with a dataset called **GameZone**, which contains information about sales, orders, refunds, products, regions, and marketing channels.

The main goal of this project was to understand **sales performance**, analyze **refund behavior**, identify patterns over time. I also performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to see what drove the revenue drops.

## Data Preparation
The raw data was cleaned and prepared using **Excel**.

Key data cleaning steps included:
- Fixing inconsistent date formats  
- Removing duplicate records  
- Handling missing values  
- Creating helper columns (e.g. year, month, refund indicators)

The cleaned dataset was then used for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to better understand the data and answer this question:

> **What caused revenue drops, which products were responsible, through which channels, and in which regions did they occur?**

The results were presented as a **Tableau Story**.

## Dashboard & Visualization
Using **Tableau**, I built an interactive dashboard that includes:
- Key KPIs: Total Sales, Average Order Value (AOV), and Orders  
- Sales and refunds by product  
- Sales mix and refunds mix over time  
- Regional sales analysis  
- Interactive filters for product, year, region, and marketing channel
- ...

## Tools Used
- **Excel** - data cleaning and preparation  
- **Tableau** - exploratory analysis, dashboard creation, and storytelling

## Key Outcome
This analysis helps to identify:
- Which products drive sales and refunds  
- Where and why revenue declines occurred  
- How products, channels, and regions contributed to those changes
